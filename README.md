# Vaadin Core Elements

[Vaadin elements](https://vaadin.com/elements) are an evolving set of open sourced custom HTML elements, which seamlessly extend the [Polymer Element Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org) with high-quality user interface components commonly needed in modern mobile and desktop business web applications. The following elements are included:

- [vaadin-combo-box](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-combo-box)
- [vaadin-context-menu](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-context-menu)
- [vaadin-date-picker](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-date-picker)
- [vaadin-grid](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-grid)
- [vaadin-split-layout](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-split-layout)
- [vaadin-icons](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-icons)

Vaadin Core Elements is a bundle that contains all the free elements, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. In addition, we have commercially licensed elements, such as [Vaadin Charts](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-charts).
